# Why AWS?
I created a Mind Map that helped me figure out my next move. Mapping out my Whys, I quickly decided a career in Cloud would check all the boxes. So then I asked Twitter friends & IRL friends how to start learning Cloud. Most of them pointed me to the same course, which happened to be an AWS SAA course. I checked out the course and loved it. So AWS became my primary Cloud focus.
