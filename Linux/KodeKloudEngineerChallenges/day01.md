# Beginner Linux Courses

## KodeKloud's [Learning Linux Basics Course & Labs](https://kodekloud.com/courses/the-linux-basics-course/)
I did start their [**_Learning Linux Basics Course & Labs_**](https://kodekloud.com/courses/the-linux-basics-course/). I like how you progress through the course as a fictional character who started a new job where they have to learn Linux for the first time, while on the job. It's fun. It provides a structured learning path. Which helps big time when setting out to learn Linux for the first time.

If you are not already following [@NikkiMegaplaza](https://twitter.com/NikkiMegaplaza) on Twitter—you're missing out! She has a WHOLE thread of useful resources for learning Linux. [Check it out](https://twitter.com/NikkiMegaplaza/status/1152746879031152640?s=20&t=2kbe_ypsRJF2FNOHgjTvyw).

# Fun Facts
I like to study in 25-minutes intervals. In between those intervals I either play God Of War: Ragnarok or work on my LEGO The Mighty Bowser build 😁
