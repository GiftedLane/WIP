# Start Taking an AWS Solutions Architect Course
First, I needed to determine which platform to learn about or what Cloud job to go after. So, I asked my cloud friends how I could start learning Cloud. The majority pointed me to the same AWS Solutions Architect Associate course. So, I checked out the course and loved it. And that's how AWS became my primary focus. 

## The Plan 

-  ♾️ Tactic 1 > Start going through the online self-paced [AWS SAA course](https://learn.cantrill.io/p/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate-saa-c03)
-  ♾️ Tactic 2 > Start seeking entry-level Cloud job openings via Twitter posts, LinkedIn, my current emplorer, etc.
-  ♾️ Tactic 3 > Set aside a minimum of 2 hours a day to study in 25-minute intervals with 5-minute breaks between intervals
-  ♾️ Tactic 4 > Deep-dive into the SAA topics in the online course so I can speak on them in interviews
-  ♾️ Tactic 5 > Jot down topics I felt I was weak in when asked certain questions during interviews, and study them
