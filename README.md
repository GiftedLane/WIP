# Cloud Zero to AWS Hero
In April 2022, I began my **FIRST** cloud role as a **Cloud Network Engineer** _(AWS-focused)_. I had **_zero cloud certs_** and **_no previous cloud experience_**. Check out [my YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@giftedlane) to see how I pulled that off. Five months later, I became a **Cloud Associate Architect**. This repo is my cloud diary. It documents what I am learning along the way and how.
